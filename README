Decentralized Marketplace for Digital Assets
This project is a blockchain-based marketplace where artists and creators can sell digital assets directly to buyers. It ensures that creators receive royalties on resales and keeps a transparent record of all transactions.

A. Features
1. Artists can list digital assets such as music, e-books, and design files.
2. Buyers can purchase assets directly without middlemen.
3. Smart contracts handle royalty payments on resales.
4. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

B. Setup Instructions
1. Install Requirements
  a. Use Remix IDE for writing and deploying the smart contract.
2. Deploying the Smart Contract
  a. Open Remix IDE.
3. Create a new file and name it DecentralizedMarketplace.sol.
  a. Copy and paste the smart contract code.
4. Compile the contract using Solidity version 0.8.24.
5. Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
6. Select Injected Provider- Remix IDE(Cancun).
7. Click Deploy and confirm the transaction in Metamask.

b. An asset is added using addAsset.
c. Asset details are checked using getAssetDetails.
d. The asset is purchased using buyAsset (with the correct amount of ETH).
e. Ownership is successfully transferred.

2. Once sold, an asset cannot be bought again.
3. Royalties are automatically deducted and paid to the original creator.
4. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy and use the contract easily. Let me know if you need further clarification.
